Please follow the step by step guideline to run this API.

## Preparation
Ensure that `node` and `npm` are installed. <br>
You should be able to open up your terminal or DOS Shell and run `node -v` and `npm -v`. Both commands should output a version number. <br>

If they are not installed, <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager" target="">here</a> is the link to install `Node.js` with Package Manager.

Make sure you have the following:<br>
```
node
npm
```
